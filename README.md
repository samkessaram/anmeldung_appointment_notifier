# anmeldung_appointment_notifier

I threw this script together while living in Berlin in order to get an appointment at the Bürgeramt so that I could register with the city. It was hard to find an appointment, so I decided to automate the process a bit. It scrapes the list calendar for available appointments and alerts the user if one is open. 

##### Notes:
1. This isn't restricted to any particular Bürgeramt location.
2. It won't actually book the appointment for you. I was working on that feature, but then I got an appointment and moved on to another project.
